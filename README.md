# Python-modules
This repository is to include some Python modules that I have created, 
mostly for amusement purposes, just because I can.  

Of course, all are provided with no guarantees or warranties on use.  ;)  

## dice.py ##
This module is one for simulating dice rolls, or for generating the probability 
distribution of dice rolls.  This can include "non-standard" dice as specified 
by the user (within certain constraints, see the description in the file itself).
